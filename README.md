## Running the Application Locally

For running within an IDE, run `bin/main.dart`. By default, a configuration file named `config.yaml` will be used.

run typescript on js/src eg "tsc --build js/src/tsconfig.json". Output is set to js/js

run a minifier on js/js folder with output set to js/js-min
Or,
do not change isDev variable in channel.dart to false for production, and it will deliver un-minified js (easier to debug)
